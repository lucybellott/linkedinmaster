# Mastermind

Mastermind is a game where the computer generates a secret code of four numbers between 0 and 7. The player must guess the secret code based on hints provided. The computer will inform the player when:
<br/>
- They have guessed a correct number in the correct position.
<br/>
- They have guessed a correct number in the wrong position. 
<br/>
- If none of the numbers guessed are correct. 
<br/>
It will not reveal which number was guessed correctly.
<br/>
A player will have 10 attempts to guess the combination.
